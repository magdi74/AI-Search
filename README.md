This project main idea is to insert some nodes to the graph and AI uses the selected search technique to solve them with a friendly GUI. 
The project has 4 types of search techniques: Iterative Deepening, Breadth-First search, Uniform-Cost search and A* search. also it has 2 types of graph: directed and undirected graph. 
The user can add nodes, add edges and remove them as well and can set "one or many" nodes as a goal node by adding a space between them and the search will show the first goal node reached from these goal nodes.
